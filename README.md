🛡 Security & Audits
We take security seriously. 
- ✅ **Audit by Quantstamp** *(Coming Soon!)*
- 🛠 **Bug Bounty**: Earn up to $100K for critical vulnerabilities.
- 🛠 **Quantun/Future-Proof Architecture**: General encryption, used to protect information exchanged across a public network; and digital signatures, used for identity authentication. Implementation of NIST audited algorithms — CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Sphincs+ and FALCON.  
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 203 standard for general encryption with smaller encryption keys that two parties can exchange easily, as well as its speed of operation. The Xmonera standard is based on the CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm, which has been renamed ML-KEM, short for Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism.
The xmonera ecosystem also utilizes FIPS 204, intended as the primary standard for protecting digital signatures. The standard uses the CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithm, which has been renamed ML-DSA, short for Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm.
The Xmonera R&D Labs are working with FIPS 205, also designed for digital signatures, a standard that employs the Sphincs+ algorithm, which has been renamed SLH-DSA, short for Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm. The standard is based on a different math approach than ML-DSA, and it is intended as a backup method in case ML-DSA proves vulnerable..
